            <p class="blockquote">As United Methodists we believe that we are on a lifelong journey of faith–always growing and changing, teaching and learning. Each of us needs to continually grow into Christ and live in ways that are patterned after the life of Christ. The teaching ministry of our pastor and our congregation helps ensure this continued growth.<br><br>
            Christian Education at Clinton United Methodist Church is for everyone.  We are committed to creating disciples of Jesus Christ to share His Good News with our community and the world.  The words over our front entrance remind us to “Enter to Worship, Go Out to Serve.”<br><br> 
            At Clinton United Methodist Church we offer a variety of opportunities for quality Christian education adults, youth and children:</p>

                <h4>Sunday School</h4> <p>Infants and toddlers are lovingly cared for during worship in the nursery room. Preschool and school-age children are excused from the worship service following  children’s time to attend Sunday School where they are invited to learn the    teachings of God and Jesus Christ. Preteens and teens study and learn together in our Youth Room with engaging wall art and teen-friendly furnishings.</p>
                <h4>Youth Group</h4> <p>Our youth group for grades 6-12 meets twice each month.  We help our young  people grow in their faith in Jesus Christ through scripture study, activities, and mission.</p>
                <h4>Vacation Bible School</h4> <p>Vacation Bible School is offered to the community each summer with separate sessions for preschool and school-age children. Adult and teen volunteers are always welcome.  We also invite people in our community  each year to share  with the children a talent or interest they have that ties into our theme for the  week.</p>
                <h4>Bible Study</h4><p>We are developing small groups throughout the congregation. The groups will bring people together in areas of study, fellowship, prayer, and cultural concerns. Our goal over time is to have people connected in a small group setting. If you would like to belong to a small group, please contact Pastor Jeff.   Seasonal Bible studies are also offered throughout the year.</p>
