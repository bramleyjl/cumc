            <h2><strong>Daily Routine</strong></h2>
                <p>We start our sessions with child-chosen activities.  The classroom is arranged with activity and creativity centers that include a block area to inspire building and counting skills and a dolls/kitchen/dress-up area for role playing and pretend play.  Additionally puzzles, books, trucks, trains, animals, writing and art supplies are always available to our students.  Circle Time provides the opportunity for us to come together as a group to enjoy songs, stories and discussions relative to our daily theme.  A daily craft project follows our discussion.  After sharing a snack, children enjoy games, stories and outdoor play (weather permitting) on our secure playground with direct access from the classroom.</p>
            <h2><strong>Summer Activities</strong></h2>
                <p>Plan to join us for a variety of preschool summer camps (preregistration required) and weekly drop-in “Summer Stories.”</p>
